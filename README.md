# NLP_Project

<h2>🚀 Key Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>📚 Fine-Tuned BERT-Based Models:</strong><br>
  Utilized pre-trained transformer models like <code>bert-base-uncased</code> and <code>distilbert-base-uncased</code> for the Question Answering task, fine-tuned on custom data.</li>

  <li><strong>📝 Custom Dataset Preprocessing:</strong><br>
  Implemented detailed preprocessing logic to align context, question, and answer spans, including precise token-to-character offset mapping for accurate label alignment.</li>

  <li><strong>🧠 Transfer Learning:</strong><br>
  Leveraged the power of transfer learning by starting from pre-trained weights and adapting the models to a domain-specific question answering dataset.</li>

  <li><strong>📊 Training and Evaluation:</strong><br>
  Trained the models using Hugging Face’s <code>Trainer</code> API and evaluated them with custom metrics such as F1 score and Exact Match (EM).</li>

  <li><strong>📉 Loss Tracking:</strong><br>
  Monitored training and validation loss to diagnose underfitting, overfitting, and model generalization across epochs.</li>

  <li><strong>🧪 Testing on Unseen Data:</strong><br>
  Tokenized and evaluated the model on a held-out test set to simulate real-world usage and validate performance.</li>

  <li><strong>💾 Model Checkpointing:</strong><br>
  Saved and reused trained models, enabling reloading for future evaluation or deployment without retraining.</li>

  <li><strong>📈 Visualizations (Optional):</strong><br>
  Enabled visual analysis of model performance trends (e.g., training vs validation loss) to guide optimization.</li>

  <li><strong>🧪 Experimentation-Ready:</strong><br>
  Modular code structure allows easy experimentation with other transformer models (e.g., RoBERTa, ALBERT) and hyperparameter tuning.</li>
</ul>
